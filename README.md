### Visulan

The bitmap pattern matching concept is inspired by a research paper of Visulan, a programming language that uses bitmap pattern matching.

### ARC-AGI

English: This puzzle game is created to deepen the understanding of ARC-AGI, one of the AI benchmarks. Solving such puzzles is considered difficult with current AI, and new approaches are needed to break through it. As one of those approaches, I am considering bitmap pattern matching.
